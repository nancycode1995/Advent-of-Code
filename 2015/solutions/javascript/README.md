# Advent of Code 2015 in JavaScript

Here are my complete solutions for year 2015 of Advent of Code written in JavaScript. ^.^

## How to run it

You can calculate the answers to both parts of all days in order like this:
```bash
node .
```

If you want to calculate the answers to both parts of a particular day (say, day 15) you can do so like this:
```bash
node . 15
```

You can even calculate the answer only to a particular part (say, part 2) of a particular day (say, day 7) like this:
```bash
node . 7 2
```

The above invocations will always test calculated answers against the known answers found in `../../answers/`.
